Title: Todo List

Description: This project has a todo list that allows you to add and remove items. The files in this project contain code provided by the Full Stack Development with MERN course with edits by me.

How to run: Download all files. Use powershell and navigate to the folder with the downloads. Start a server in that folder and put its address in your browser.

Future improvements: I would like to make a seperate button for delete.
